The purpose of this project was to design an interface for a neighborhood park information-sharing platform. We were tasked with sketching mock-up prototypes for both a mobile and a desktop web interfaces for the Park application. Once we had our draw-ups down for we elected to do our digital prototype on the mobile app.

The tasks we began the application with were:
- Task 1: Searching for parks with specific features (e.g., playgrounds, pet-friendly).
- Task 3: Finding accessible parks (safe, quality amenities, wheelchair access, etc.).
- Task 4: Finding a pet-friendly and clean park.
- Task 5: Reporting safety issues or maintenance concerns.
- Task 6: Searching for events or organizing park-based functions.

Key Features: 
Our application included a main menu where a user can search for a park in the area of their choosing or by using keywords. There is also a filter button next to the search bar that allows the user to select or remove any amenities that they wish to search for(pet-friendly, playgrounds, walking trails, handicapped amenities, benches, picnic areas, etc.). 

Once the park of their choice is selected by clicking on the ping of the park location on the map it presents the user with park information such as hours, a few amenities, the park website, a reviews button, and a "report issue" button. The user can search for and find events happening at parks they are searching for as well.

Via our peer feedback, we we made sure to make sure all button labels were made clearer for their exact intended purposes. We included a section where an image of the park is included when the park page is up.

The user can return to the home page simply by selecting the home button. They can return to the filter tab anytime they please if they want to alter their search to find other parks.

The buttons are all clearly labeled and require no additional "figuring out" and should be usable by anyone easily regardless of their computer/phone savvy.
